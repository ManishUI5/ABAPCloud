Get Clean 
Business processes to be standardized
Customizations to be replaced using clean core development approach
Obsolete customizations  to be decommissioned 
Technology debt to be reduced and created as “informed decisions”
Modernize integrations, extensions & automations

Stay Clean 
Zero-modification policy to be applied
Use modern integration patterns - leverage API & Event Economy
Introduce incremental innovation with SAP BTP (or other cloud platforms)
Cloning of SAP standard functionality to be avoided

Run to New
Always keep the SAP S/4HANA core clean with continuous governance by aligning to standard SAP when possible.
Best-case scenario describes an up-to-date system on the latest release, with cloud compliant extensions as well as integration, with optimal data quality and process design.

Path
Apply 4E Framework 
  Embrace - Implementing Standard SAP with public cloud mindset using SAP best Practice 
  Elevate - Use best Practice to build specfic Process enabled by SAP 
  Enhance - process by addressing gaps in Standard SAP technology 
  Exclude - Process that are deemed out of scope , supported by manual process 
Classify and group items to Embrace standard, Elevate / Enhance with new innovations and Exclude/Remove unused custom elements.
Keep the core clean - Establish and monitor clean core governance. Document technical debt. Measure the clean core adoption. Ensure development teams follow clean core approach.

Perform gap analysis and identify REFW list. Validate gaps against future product roadmaps

Setup goverence team/Board 
Report - SAP S/4 Embedded Analystics , SAC , SAP Fiori 
ABAP report to be approved by Goverence 
Enhancement and form - Cloud ABAP code , BTP Pro-code , RAP , Native Mobile App 
Classic ABAP to be approved 
Workflow and Automation - Standard workflow , Flexiable workflow , SAP BPA , SAP workzone 
ABAP workflow to be approved 
Move from Tier 3 to Tier 1 
Clean coreTier 1 - ABAP CLoud , Developer extensibility , Key user extensibility , Side by Side extension 
Tier 1 is upgrade stable development (ABAP Cloud on ABAP stack or BTP Service) 
Lean core Tier 2 - Use of Non-released API , create wrapper API and release , when SAP api is available delete customer wrapper

Not Clean Core - Classic Extension , Implict , cloning SAP code etc 
Not upgrade stable 
Complex Customization Needs: Organizations may have complex and unique business requirements that necessitate classical development rather than leveraging a clean core. This allows them to preserve essential custom functionalities.

Less support of ABAP Cloud to few modules (for example in SAP Extended Warehouse Management (EWM) and SAP Master Data Governance modules (MDG)) : Many of the process and customization in few modules like EWM , MDG are still classical as ABAP cloud is still to mature in these modules.

Some business processes or enhancements (e.g., VOFM routines, BAdIs, enhancement points) are still only available in classical ABAP

Not all SAP standard transactions are Fiori-enabled yet. SAP also has Webdynpro applications. Thus, any customizations in these transactions need classical Tier 3 developments. 

The other factors could be :

Legacy System Dependencies: Many companies have existing legacy systems that require integration with SAP S/4HANA, leading to higher classical development activities to accommodate specific business processes that are not covered by standard features.
Customization Culture: Historically, organizations have heavily customized their ERP environments. This culture persists, even as companies transition to newer platforms like S/4HANA, leading to continued preference for customization through classical development.
Lack of Adoption of Extension Platforms: While SAP has introduced platforms like SAP BTP for extensions, not all organizations have adopted these solutions due to factors such as costs, skill shortages, or transitional development strategies.
Gradual Transition Process: The move from on-premise systems to S/4HANA often involves phased migrations, during which traditional approaches and classical development practices might be utilized temporarily.
Insufficient Knowledge and Training: There may be a lack of awareness or training on maintaining a clean core, resulting in higher classical development as organizations continue approaches familiar from previous SAP versions.

Benefit of Clean core 
1. Long term cost saving - 3-5% reduction in Upgrade effort , shorter remdediation effort, shorter conversion cycle 
2. Predictable & Easier upgrade - Minimize overall upgrade risk 
4. Reduced Maintenence cost - Build effort is future safe 
5. Innovation at speed - new Capability such as gen ai can be embrased quickly , Joule etc
